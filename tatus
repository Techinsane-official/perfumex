     Key Fixes for Running  Pending Issue:
    - Increased Vercel function timeout to 300s for scraping APIs

    - Added ultra-fast serverless browser configuration
    - Implemented aggressive timeout protection (10s browser, 5s page)
    - Disabled JavaScript, images, and non-essential features for speed
    
     Serverless Optimizations:
    - Ultra-minimal Chrome args for maximum startup speed

    - Detailed timing logs for debugging
    
     Performance Improvements:
    - 15s browser launch timeout vs 30s default
    - Disabled images, JS, and other bandwidth-heavy features
    - Single-process mode for serverless compatibility
    - Faster failure detection and recovery
